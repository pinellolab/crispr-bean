`bean` improves CRISPR pooled screen analysis by 1) unconfounding variable per-guide editing outcome by considering genotypic outcome from *reporter* sequence and 2) through accurate modeling of screen procedure.

## Overview
`bean` supports end-to-end analysis of pooled sorting screens, with or without reporter.

`bean` subcommands include the following: Click on the [`links`]() to see the full documentation.
1. [`count`](https://pinellolab.github.io/crispr-bean/count.html), [`count-samples`](https://pinellolab.github.io/crispr-bean/count_samples.html): Base-editing-aware **mapping** of guide, optionally with reporter from `.fastq` files.
    *   [`create-screen`](https://pinellolab.github.io/crispr-bean/create_screen.html) creates minimal ReporterScreen object from flat gRNA count file. Note that this way, allele counts are not included and many functionalities involving allele and edit counts are not supported.
2. [`profile`](https://pinellolab.github.io/crispr-bean/profile.html): Profile editing preferences of your editor.  
3. [`qc`](https://pinellolab.github.io/crispr-bean/qc.html): Quality control report and filtering out / masking of aberrant sample and guides  
4. [`filter`](https://pinellolab.github.io/crispr-bean/filter.html): Filter reporter alleles; essential for `tiling` mode that allows for all alleles generated from gRNA.
5. [`run`](https://pinellolab.github.io/crispr-bean/run.html): Quantify targeted variants' effect sizes from screen data. **See more about the [model](https://pinellolab.github.io/crispr-bean/model.html) & [output](https://pinellolab.github.io/crispr-bean/run.html#output)**
* Screen data is saved as [`ReporterScreen` object](https://pinellolab.github.io/crispr-bean/reporterscreen.html) in the pipeline.
BEAN stores mapped gRNA and allele counts in `ReporterScreen` object which is compatible with [AnnData](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). 

## Installation 
First install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/).
Then download from PyPI:
```bash
pip install crispr-bean
```

For the latest version of `bean` (and for the test files in `tests/data`), install from Github:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pinellolab/crispr-bean.git
cd crispr-bean
pip install -e .
```

### Library design: variant or tiling?
The `bean filter` and `bean run` steps depend on the type of gRNA library design, where BEAN supports two modes of running.
<img src="docs/assets/library_design.png" alt="variant library design" width="700"/>  

1. `variant` library: Several gRNAs tile each of the targeted variants. Only the editing rate of the target variant is considered and the bystander effects are ignored.  
    * :heavy_plus_sign: Increase power for your target variant, as the signal is not distributed across likely no-effect bystanders.
    * :heavy_minus_sign: Ignores potential bystander effect
    * :heavy_check_mark: Suitable for noncoding GWAS variant screens.


2. `tiling` library: gRNA densely tiles a long region (e.g. gene(s), exon(s), coding sequence(s)). Bystander edits are considered to obtain alleles with significant fractions. Edited alleles can be "translated" to output coding variants.
    * :heavy_plus_sign: Considers bystander effect
    * :heavy_minus_sign: If the library results in alleles that are not diverse enough across gRNAs, signal will likely be diluted to all variants in that alleles. (ex. Allele "GGGGG" with a single gRNA score will distribute scores across 5 G's.)
    * :heavy_check_mark: Suitable for coding variant screens with tiling design.

## Using BEAN as Python module
```
import bean as be
cdata = be.read_h5ad("bean_counts_sample.h5ad")
```
Python package `bean` supports multiple data wrangling functionalities for `ReporterScreen` objects. See the [**ReporterScreen API tutorial**](docs/ReporterScreen_api.ipynb) for more detail.

## Run time
* Installation takes 14.4 mins after pytorch installation with pytorch in Dell XPS 13 Ubuntu WSL.
* `bean run` takes 4.6 mins with `--scale-by-acc` tag in Dell XPS 13 Ubuntu WSL for variant screen dataset with 3455 guides and 6 replicates with 4 sorting bins.
* Full pipeline takes 90.1s in GitHub Action for toy dataset of 2 replicates and 30 guides.
